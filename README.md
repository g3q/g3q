### **WHO AM I**
I am a security guard, crypto lord, technophile & video game enthusiast. I also do cyber security along with my security job, I'm looking to go to collage and get a C|EH certification.

### **9+ YEARS OF EXPERIENCE**
I have been modding, coding and hacking for over 9 years now, it has been my biggest hobby and interest and I wish to put my abilities in the best place I can. I have helped several celebrities and companies secure their websites, networks and media accounts. I started by learning basic self-XSS, and quickly moved towards learning the SQL Language as I wished to work with databases. I now do my own work, after working with many big teams and groups which shall not be named anymore but I freelance for penetration testing as it still gives me a good way to gain experience, other wise I will use hackerone.com for bug bounties in my spare time.

### **WHAT CAN I DO**
- üñ•Ô∏è Program in C#, C++, Python, Shell
- üñ•Ô∏è Operate penetration tests on websites and networks, finding the most common issues like XSS, SQLi, CSRF etc..
- üñ•Ô∏è Identify any missing security headers such as HSTS, CSP, X-XSS, etc.. 
- üñ•Ô∏è Modify just about any game, system or video game console

### **WHO HAVE I WORKED WITH**
- Dakotaz (Live Streamer)
- PicsArt (Photo Editing Platform)
- Pixlr (Photo Editing Platform)
- Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (Car Company)
- There's too many to list, but those were most notable in my eyes.
